        <p style="text-align: center;">Bettas, especially males, are known as aggressive and territorial. Male betta fish can’t be with other betts, but did you know that female betta fish can live in groups? It’s not for beginners, but it’s a fun fact… and it got me curious as to what tank mates betta fish could be with. After a little research, I set up an observational experiment with three betta tanks, keeping everything consistent except for the tank mates to see which was best: one lone betta, one betta with snails & shrimp, and one betta with a group of tetras. I watched them for months, and this is what I learned..</p>
